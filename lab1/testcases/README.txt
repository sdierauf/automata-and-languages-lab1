Some of the testcases are concrete applications of regular patterns:

  test case  6:  matching valid phone numbers
  test case  7:  matching valid e-mail addresses
  test case  8:  matching syntactically correct quantified formulas
  test case  9:  matching odd numbers
  test case 10:  matching valid e-mail addresses
  test case 11:  matching valid IP addresses

Test cases 6-9 of the above were contributed by Oliver Schwarz, and
test cases 10-11 by Axel Boldt-Christmas, both in April 2014.
